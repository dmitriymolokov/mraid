"Seraphina!"
"Mom?" My throat was raw, I jolted awake in bed. She hadn't reached out in ten years-not unless it was the worst kind of news.
Her voice trembled through the phone, sharp and brittle.
"Your father-" Her breath hitched, then broke. "He's been attacked."
My stomach clenched. Ice-cold fear gripped me.
"What?!"
"Oh, Sera, he's barely clinging to life!" my mother sobbed brokenly.
I immediately threw the covers off me and jumped out of bed.
"Send me the hospital address," I said in a shaky voice. "I'll be there as soon as I can."
I tried not to make too much noise as I rushed down the stairs so I wouldn't wake my son, Daniel. 
The light underneath my husband, Kieran's, office told me he was still up. As Alpha of the pack, he always had too much to handle.
And if I were honest with myself-too much resentment toward me.

A decade-old mistake had bound us together. A mistake he'd never forgiven.

So, I didn't plan to bother him.

By the time I slid into the driver's seat, tears streaked down my face.

My father had always been invincible. Unshakable. The giant of my heart, even if he'd never wanted me as his daughter.

Even if he'd hated me. But I never imagined he could be taken from me like this-

I slammed my foot on the accelerator.

When I reached the hospital, my mother and brother sat like shadows outside the operating room. My ch**t tightened. Would the giant really fall?

I hesitated. I couldn't bring myself to step closer. Not when their disgust had exiled me long ago. 

After that night ten years ago, they'd erased me. To the world, they had only one daughter now-Celeste.

Should I even be here?

It had been ten years since we last spoke. Even after Daniel was born, all communication with the family had gone through Kieran. 

My father had made it clear-he never wanted to see my face again.

Would he really want to see me now?

What if he didn't? What if his resentment hadn't faded?

I hesitated, my pulse pounding in my ears-until the sharp swish of the operating room doors cut through my thoughts. The doctor walked out, pulling gloves off his fingers.

"Doctor!" I rushed forward before I could stop myself, my voice shaking. "How is my father?"

The grim expression on his face said it all. "I'm sorry. We did all we could... but his injuries were far too severe."

I pressed a hand to my mouth, choking back the sob clawing up my throat.

"Is he... gone?" Ethan, my brother, barely glanced at me before addressing the doctor, his voice rough.

"Not yet." The man shook his head slowly. "But he won't last the night. He's been asking for his daughter."

I took an instinctive step forward-then froze.

His daughter.

It couldn't be me. After ten years of indifference and resentment, the daughter my dying father wanted to see would never be me.

Ethan's laugh was ice. "Ten years, and our family is still paying for your mistakes!"

I turned to face him, tears streaking my cheeks. A decade since I'd last stood this close-since he'd looked at me. 

Time had sharpened him into a true Alpha: broader shoulders, harder jaw, a dominance that rolled off him in waves.

But the hatred in his eyes?

That hadn't changed.

My heart gave a vicious twist, like claws raking flesh.

"Because of you," he snarled at me, "Celeste moved away. Because of you, she can't be here. Because of you, Dad will die with his last wish unfulfilled."

"Yes, it's all my fault." My laugh was bitter, weighted with decades of pain. "After all these years, I'm still the first one blamed. No one cares about the truth-or how I feel!"

Tears burst forth, my outburst freezing Ethan for a heartbeat. 

But just as quickly, his voice turned razor-sharp:"Your feelings? You stole your sister's fiancé and dare to talk about feelings?"

My nails dug deep into my palms, reopening that ugly old scar.

Ten years ago, at the Blood Moon Hunt, I'd just turned twenty-the age when every werewolf finds their mate. 

After a lifetime of being overlooked, I'd been desperate for that bond.

As a child, I'd fo**ishly dreamed it might be Kieran. 

But then he fell for Celeste-perfect, radiant Celeste, the darling of the entire Frostbane Pack-and I learned my place soon enough.

What was I? The Alpha's defective daughter, the one who couldn't even shift. Nothing.

When even my own family and pack barely spared me a glance, how could Kieran possibly want me? I never expected to change anything. 

But that night, when I heard about his impending engagement to Celeste, the pain cut deeper than any claw. For the first time, I let myself drown in drink.

I expected to wake up forgotten in some dark corner. Never did I imagine I'd find myself n**ed in Kieran's bed.

The li**or had burned through my senses. That night remained a haze of fractured memories. 

Before I could piece together what happened, Celeste burst in-her shriek slicing through the air as she took in the scene.

Then came the chaos: Celeste's hysterical sobs, Kieran's guilt-ridden apologies, the pack's venomous whispers, my stammered explanations-all silenced by my father's resounding s**p across my face.

"I regret ever bringing you into this world!"

The aftermath played out in muted horror. Kieran carrying Celeste's unconscious form to the infirmary. Ethan snarling at gawking packmates. My mother's muffled weeping.

And Father's eyes-Gods-that look of pure revulsion. I'd always known he despised me, but never with such intensity it stole the breath from my lungs.

"I didn't..." My whisper died unheard. No one listened. No one.

Overnight, I became the pack's favorite sin to punish. Where they'd once mocked my defective shifting, now they spat "wh**e" like a benediction.

Even low-ranking Omegas cornered me in shadowed corridors, their hands and insults alike too bold. 

Females crossed themselves when I passed, hissing "husband-thief" like a cu**e.

The weight of it crushed me. When Celeste's admirers left death threats carved into my door, I gathered what little I owned and fled under a new moon. 

I intended to vanish forever... until the morning sickness began. Until the physician announced my pr**nancy to the entire Bl**d Council.

That was the only reason Kieran married me. He was an honorable man, an Alpha who would never desert his heir.

Yet it tore my family apart.

My parents and brother hated me for breaking Celeste's heart. Kieran's pack, NightFang, loathed me because I was not the Luna they wanted. And Celeste was so enraged, she moved abroad.

"You ruined everything!" Ethan's accusing voice cut through my thoughts. The venom in his glare cut deep. Undiluted after a decade.

Bl**d may have made us siblings, but Ethan had never once treated me as his sister. Celeste was the only sister he cherished. He loathed me for driving her away.

But was it truly all my fault? I may be weak and ordinary, but never so vile as to deliberately se**ce my sister's lover.

Yet they never cared. They just needed someone to blame.

"See this?" My hands trembled, but my voice hardened like winter frost. 

"My voice was never heard. My existence never mattered. So tell me, Mom-" I turned to face her, throat constricted. 

"If you never wanted me, why didn't you just smother me in my cradle? Why pretend I still mattered enough to call me here?"

"How dare you speak to Mom like that?!" Ethan roared, his canines lengthening. 

"Marrying Kieran didn't magically make you Luna material. That title was always meant for Celeste!"

"I never asked for any of this!" I snarled back, bitterness filling my tone. 

"I was ready to disappear. You could have let Celeste and Kieran have their perfect mating ceremony and pretended I never existed!"

Ethan's lips curled mockingly. "Don't play the martyr," he sneered. "You knew d**n well Kieran would never abandon his pup-"

"Ethan!" Mother's command carried the faintest echo of her former Luna authority, though her scent now held only exhaustion and grief. 

"Enough. We will not waste your father's final moments on this old bl**d feud."

She couldn't even look at me as she said, "Go see your father." 

Her gaze darted away like the sight of me pained her. Ethan shot me one last venomous glare before slumping into a chair.

Steeling myself, I pushed open the door.

The fear nearly choked me-fear of seeing that familiar disappointment in his eyes one last time. 

But when I saw him lying there, the man I'd spent my life both fearing and longing to please...

Gone was the towering figure of my nightmares. The father who'd once seemed invincible now lay motionless, his ch**t swathed in bandages, his face ashen. 

The eyes that had always burned with contempt when they looked at me... now held nothing at all.

Tears streamed down my face. Why did this hurt so much?

This man-this giant who'd hated me from the moment I presented as a wolfless. Who'd looked at Celeste with pride and me with shame.

The memory of our last meeting still clawed at my heart.

There had been no wedding for Kieran and me. No celebration. Only my father's iron grip forcing my hand to scrawl my name on the marriage paper.

"Now you've gotten what you wanted," he'd snarled, his Alpha power choking the air between us. "From this day forward, you are no daughter of mine."

I'd never wept so vi**ently-never begged so desperately. 

But all I earned was the frozen line of his back and his final, venomous curse: "Your birth was a mistake, Seraphina. Dare to show your face again, and I swear you'll never know another moment of happiness."

He kept his promise.

His cu**e had poisoned every moment of my life, while my "honorable" husband turned our marriage into a gilded cage with his endless silence and contempt.

I should have hated them all-this family, this fate.

But when my father's fingers twitched weakly on the sheets, my traitorous heart lurched.

Before I could think, I was at his side, clutching his ice-cold hand.

"Dad?" My voice trembled with something dangerously close to hope.

His pale lips parted slightly, as if struggling to form words.

But before he could speak-

BEEEP-!

The heart monitor screamed. The line on the screen flattened.

"NO!" The cry tore from my throat. He couldn't leave-not like this. 

Not before I saw forgiveness in his eyes. Not before we could unravel the knots binding our hearts.

The door burst open. Ethan and Mother shoved me aside, sending me crashing to the floor.

"He's gone..." Mother collapsed against Ethan, her body wracked with violent sobs. "My mate... my Alpha...!"

Ethan's grief choked him silently-until his gaze locked onto me. His wolf was on the surface, teeth bared. 

I didn't doubt for a second he'd rip my throat out. Until Mother caught his arm.

"You viper," he hissed. "Whatever scrap of happiness you've clung to-I'll rip it from you."

A hollow laugh echoed through my mind. Why were they all so obsessed with stealing my happiness? Something I'd never had.

The doctor entered, murmuring to my mother, "Luna, we must prepare Alpha Edward's remains."

I numbly walked into the hall, my soul scraped raw, tears falling unchecked. As the pack's elite arrived, none acknowledged me-just as it had always been.

But their indifference barely influenced me now. 

I stood numb before the chamber holding Father's body, still unable to grasp the truth that he would never open his eyes to us again-

Until Kieran's voice cut through the silence.

"My deepest condolences, Margaret." He took my mother's hands, every inch the dutiful son-in-law. "Rest assured, I'll assist Ethan with every arrangement."

Moonlight from the windows gilded his broad shoulders, the silver streaks at his temples only heightening the aura of a prime Alpha in his prime. 

Not a hair out of place despite the midnight summons.

The deadliest Alpha of the NightFang Pack. Just his presence was enough to control the air.

"Your presence comforts me, Kieran," Mother wept, clutching his arm.

When he embraced her, those piercing dark eyes found mine over her shoulder-then flicked away as if spotting a stain on the wall.

"What exactly happened?" he asked as he turned to Ethan. "How could Edward get attacked?"

Ethan's jaw clenched. "Routine border patrol. But the ba**ard rogues came in numbers we've never seen-armed with silver weapons." His throat worked as he fought for control. 

"It was an ambush. Father never stood a chance."

My mother's renewed sobs filled the corridor. Kieran gripped Ethan's shoulder-

"The rogues will pay for this," he vowed.

I hovered at the periphery, an outsider in my own family's tragedy.

The three of them-Mother, Ethan, and Kieran-stood united in their grief, an unbreakable circle I couldn't penetrate.

"I've sent for Celeste," Ethan added suddenly. "She should be arriving soon."

"Oh, my poor girl!" Mother wept into her hands. "To miss her father's final moments..."

My gaze flickered unbidden to Kieran's face.

Our eyes locked again.

His expression remained unreadable-arctic, assessing, utterly devoid of warmth.

Ten years sharing a b*d, yet he still felt galaxies away. I'd never touched his heart.

And now, with Celeste's return, a terrible truth crushed my ch**t like an iron weight: I was about to lose my second family.

If my wolf lived within me, she would have whined low in her throat. I didn't know if I could survive the coming storm-but one thing burned brighter than fear:

No matter what arrived, no one would take my son from me.

No one.

Chapter 2 SERAPHINA'S POV--COLD AND EMPTY
The fragile silence was shattered as a piercing cry echoed down the sterile hallway.

"Papa! Where are you?"

Every head turned in unison. My stomach plummeted as Celeste came into view-her golden hair whipping behind her, cheeks flushed from running. 

Her eyes were rimmed with tears, but her beauty remained utterly breathtaking.

After ten years, my sister's sudden appearance struck me like a physical blow.

I almost instinctively turned to Kieran, whose mouth had fallen open, staring at Celeste like she was a dream he was scared to wake up from. 

The r*w longing in his eyes was enough to answer the question that had haunted me for a decade: his heart had never been mine.

"Tell me I'm not too late," Celeste begged, her voice breaking. When no one answered immediately, her knees buckled.

Kieran moved faster than any werewolf had a right to. He caught her before she hit the ground, cradling her against his ch**t as my mother and brother descended into the huddle. 

Their ta**led limbs and shared sobs painted the perfect family portrait-one I'd never been part of.

The thought clawed at my throat. I'd lost my father too. Didn't I deserve to mourn?

But this was Celeste's world. It always had been. From the moment she'd taken her first steps, everyone had watched her, admired her, loved her. 

As Celeste shone, I became a shadow.

And now, as her whimpers filled the room, I might as well have been invisible.

The exit beckoned. Better to leave with what little dignity remained than wait for their inevitable rejection.

Not a single head turned as I slipped away.

My tears had dried by the time I reached home, leaving salt tracks on my cheeks. But the hollow ache in my ch**t? That felt like it would linger forever.

My first stop was Daniel's room to check up on him.

I was surprised to see light under his door, and when I pushed it open, I found my nine-year-old curled into himself, knees drawn to his ch**t like a tiny fortress against the world.

"Mommy?" His voice was too small, too knowing.

I perched on the edge of his racecar bed. "Sweetheart, why are you up?"

He worried his lower lip between his teeth. "Something's wrong with Grandpa Edward, right?"

The air left my lungs. How did I tell this bright-eyed boy that the man who'd taught him to track deer just last summer was gone? 

I smoothed his pajama-covered knee. "Honey, there was... an incident tonight. Grandpa got hurt-"

"He died." Daniel's whisper held an eerie certainty. "Our bond... it broke."

My hand stilled. At nine, he shouldn't have been able to feel the pack bonds severing. Yet here he was, demonstrating the very wolf-sensitivity I'd spent his lifetime praying he'd inherit.

Relief warred with awe-he wouldn't be like me. Wouldn't bear the shame of being the Alpha's defective child, a werewolf whose wolf never manifested.

"Come here, my brave boy." I gathered him close, breathing in his scent of maple syrup and childish sweat.

However much I regretted that disastrous Bl**d Moon Hunt, I'd never regret the miracle it gave me.

Daniel was the one pure thing in my life-the only heart that loved me without conditions.

As I tucked the spaceship-patterned blanket around his shoulders, he turned those soulful eyes on me-Kieran's eyes in miniature.

"You and Daddy will always be here, right?"

The question lanced through me. I feathered my fingers through his hair, just like I had when he was a baby fighting sleep. "Oh, my love..."

How could I explain that his father had never truly been mine to keep? 

That the way Kieran had looked at Celeste tonight-like the sun had risen after a decade of darkness-was a look he'd never once given me? 

That their embrace in the hospital corridor had been more in**mate than any he and I had shared in ten years of marriage?

"Mommy's not going anywhere," I promised, pressing a k**s to his furrowed brow. "Your daddy and I love you more than anything," I whispered. "Nothing will ever change that."

His sleepy smile gutted me. "Night, Mommy."

"Sweet dreams, my heart." I ki**ed his forehead, lingering a moment too long before slipping out.

The kitchen's fluorescent lights buzzed as I rummaged through the fridge. Glass bottles clinked-then froze mid-reach at the sound of the front door.

Kieran. Home already.

I'd expected him to stay all night at the hospital, comforting her. Reconnecting with her.

He moved through the darkened house like a shadow, his broad shoulders filling the kitchen doorway. 

Moonlight caught the sharp angles of his face as his gaze swept over me-empty. Always empty.

The refrigerator hummed between us as he reached past my shoulder. 

His cedar-and-rain scent enveloped me for one treacherous heartbeat before he withdrew, cracking open a water bottle.

"Did you... want something to eat?" My voice sounded too small in the silence. "You missed dinner."

Nothing. Just the working of his throat as he drank, the corded muscles flexing beneath stubble I'd never been allowed to touch. 

The crushed plastic hitting the recycling bin made me flinch.

He braced himself against the countertop, head bowed like Atlas bearing the world. I knew this dance by heart-ten years of speaking to a ghost.

"I'll just..." I edged toward the doorway.

"Seraphina."

My name in his mouth was always a shock. Like being doused in ice water.

I turned slowly. Moonlight carved hollows beneath his cheekbones, his expression unreadable as ever.

"We need to talk."

The quiet words sent a bolt of dread through me. His grip on the counter turned his knuckles bone-white.

No preamble. No softening. Just Kieran's brutal efficiency, as always.

"I want a divorce."

Ten years. Ten years I'd waited for this axe to fall.

Funny how it still cut like a surprise.

Chapter 3 SERAPHINA'S POV--ALL I WANT
The words shouldn't have hurt-not after a decade of waiting for this moment. 

Yet they sliced through me like silver, the pain radiating from my shattered heart to every nerve ending.

I'd always known that Kieran would eventually ask for this. Especially now. Celeste. His first crush. His real love. Back.

It didn't matter that I'd loved him since we were children, long before Celeste ever noticed him. It didn't matter that I'd given him a son. 

The moment she returned, I became invisible-just as I'd always been in his eyes.

Celeste was the dazzling diamond, blinding everyone to the plain pebble at her feet. I knew this. So why did it still feel like my soul was being ripped in two?

"It's because of Celeste, isn't it?" My voice was eerily calm. I already knew the answer, but some masochistic part of me needed to hear him say it. 

Needed him to twist the kn**e deeper.

Kieran's eyes flashed-the first real emotion he'd shown me in years. "No," he snapped, jaw clenched. "Of course not."

Liar.

He dragged a hand through his dark brown hair, exhaling sharply. "Edward's death just... reminded me life's too short to waste on a mistake."

A mistake.

I would have preferred the kn**e. Would have rather he screamed Celeste's name than reduce our marriage-our son-to a regret.

I couldn't help but laugh out.

The sound was jagged, hysterical, tearing from my throat as Kieran stared at me like I'd lost my mind. Maybe I had.

I laughed because the alternative was screaming.

My gaze traced the lines of this man I knew yet didn't know at all, this stranger I'd loved for eighteen years who had never truly seen me.

Who was more pitiable-him or me?

He loved Celeste, yet honor and a single mistake had chained him to a marriage he never wanted. 

What had these ten years given us? If not for that night, if we hadn't been forced into this loveless union, would his eyes have held even a flicker of warmth for me?

We were never meant to be like this.

Even though I could never regret Daniel, I'd meant it that night-I'd been ready to vanish. 

I should have run farther. Should never have stepped into that clinic, never let them know about the pr**nancy.

I'd told myself staying, enduring, was for Daniel's sake. But now, I couldn't lie to myself anymore. 

What kind of life had I given him, with parents whose hearts were oceans apart? 

While Celeste was gone, Kieran had played the part of a dutiful father. But now she was back, and the fragile facade of our marriage would shatter.

I won't let my son watch his mother become a laughingstock.

"Fine," I said at last, the laughter dying on my lips.

Kieran's brows lifted. Had he expected tears? Begging? Had he wanted to see me break?

Too bad.

My entire life, people had hungered for my surrender. But I refused to give them another ounce of my pain.

When I walked away from this marriage, I would take only two things:

My dignity.

And my son.

"I want full custody of Daniel."

His shock morphed into fury. "The h**l you will! He's my son!"

"And mine!" I snarled back.

"You can't take the pack's heir from his Alpha!" Kieran's voice shook with barely leashed rage.

"And you can't take a mother's heart from her ch**t!" My hands trembled, but my voice didn't waver. "I don't want your money. Your property. Anything. Just my son."

him from me...

I wouldn't survive it.

"And most importantly... You and Celeste will have new children."

The words stole the breath from my lungs. Just the thought of it-of her giving him the pups I never could-made my ch**t ache like a fresh wound. 

But for Daniel, I would endure anything. Even this.

I watched Kieran closely, his expression unreadable in the dim kitchen light. Finally, he gave a single stiff nod.

"Fine. You can have full custody."

The catch. He agreed so easily.

Not a single denial. Not one word to contradict what I'd said about him and Celeste. He still preferred a family with her, didn't he?

And the most pathetic part? Some fo**ish, desperate corner of my heart had still hoped. 

Still waited for him to say something-anything-to prove our marriage hadn't been just a prison sentence to him.

I pressed my palms to my stinging eyes. Gods, what was wrong with me?

I couldn't afford to hope anymore. Not tonight. If I didn't leave here soon, I'd collapse right here on the cold tiles-

Then Kieran caught my wrist.

He cleared his throat awkwardly, his grip warm against my skin. "We can wait until after the funeral to finalize everything, if you prefer."

For one dangerous moment, I almost believed him. Almost thought this was kindness.

If only he'd shown me this consideration once in ten years.

I wrenched my arm free. "No need to delay. It's not like there's much to dissolve-you never even gave me a mating m**k."

The one thing he'd refused when we married. That, and loving me.

"Your wolf never came," he'd said that night we got married, his voice carefully blank. "A mating bond would only cause you pain when..."

When we inevitably divorced.

He hadn't finished the sentence, but we both knew. Just like we both knew the real reason-the mark belonged to Celeste in his mind. Always had.

The bitter truth settled in my ch**t: he'd planned for this ending from the very beginning.

What difference did it make now? Whether it was pity or premeditation, the result was the same-my neck remained unmarked, my heart remained broken, and Kieran would walk away free.

Kieran's brow furrowed deeper.

"Seraphina, there's no need for bitterness. Our marriage was a mistake-I only hope we can both move on." His voice softened, that hint of pity making my stomach churn. "You deserve-"

"Oh, spare me." I turned away before he could see how his pity cut me deeper than his anger ever could.

"Don't worry-I've saved enough to support myself and Daniel. You'll be free by tomorrow."

The shock on his face was almost comical. Had he truly expected me to fight for him? To beg?

Yes, I loved him. I still do.

But ten years of trying to thaw his heart had taught me this: no amount of warmth could melt a glacier that didn't want to be moved.

And now that Celeste was back? Did he think I'd delude myself into believing I ever stood a chance?

Why crush what's left of my pride just to feed an Alpha's ego?

I'd learned my lesson. A decade in this loveless marriage had been enough. I was done fighting for people who never wanted me.

My steps were numb as I climbed the stairs, memories of Kieran flashing like gh**ts behind my eyes:

*The bright smile he'd given me when we first met as children.

*Me watching from the shadows when he won his first Hunt.

*The way my heart shattered as he placed the victory garland on Celeste's head, her lips meeting his in a sweet k**s.

*The blur of li**or glasses when their engagement was announced.

*That catastrophic night that started it all.

*Then-Daniel's birth, his first steps, every milestone since...

Halfway up the staircase, Daniel's sleepy voice echoed in my mind:

"You and Dad will always be here, right?"

My heart lurched. Gods. How do we tell him?

I whirled around, my earlier resolve cracking. "How... how do we explain this to Daniel?"

Kieran paused mid-sip of water. "I'll handle it."

Of course. He's already planned for this, too. My fists clenched.

"And you needn't worry about finances," he added stiffly. "Daniel is still my son. I'll cover his expenses-and yours."

I couldn't read his expression. After ten years, the view I knew best was still his poker face. But this time, I refused to waste energy deciphering him.

Tomorrow, once the papers were signed, we'd be strangers. As he wished.

I turned without answering.

The bedroom door clicked shut behind me-then the dam broke.

Silent sobs wracked my body as I slid to the floor, the day's grief finally overwhelming me. Somewhere downstairs, the floorboards creaked.

Kieran was probably already packing. Probably already picturing Celeste in this house, raising my son.

My hand flew to my unmarked throat-where his teeth should have been. Where a mating bond should have sealed us together.

"It's okay, Sera," I whispered into the hollow dark, arms wrapped tight around my shaking ribs. "You'll survive this."

For my son-I'll survive anything.

Chapter 4 SERAPHINA'S POV--WHERE'S THE FIRE?
I returned from the lawyer's office feeling like my soul had been put through a shredder.

Walking through the front door gave me a strange kind of anxiety. Maybe it was because I knew this was one of the last times I would be here again.

I let my gaze roam the foyer, taking in every detail-Daniel's baby picture on the mantel, the portrait taken of Kieran when he was ordained Alpha, the picture of Daniel and me on his fifth birthday.

There were no pictures of Kieran and me. Shocker.

I headed straight to Kieran's office. I had left early in the morning, not wanting to run into him and have an awkward conversation about the upcoming divorce. 

I'd also been avoiding Daniel, I think.

How could I look into those innocent eyes and explain that his family was breaking apart?

"I don't... get it."

Daniel's small, confused voice stopped me outside Kieran's office. The door was slightly ajar, and I saw Daniel sitting in a chair in front of Kieran's desk like a visitor. 

Kieran sat opposite him, looking at our son with a tenderness he never showed me.

He leaned forward and took Daniel's hands in his. "Mommy and Daddy won't be living together anymore, champ."

"But... why?" Daniel's lower lip trembled. "Don't you love Mom?"

I tensed. How was Kieran going to answer that? Surely he wouldn't tell our son he didn't love his mother. But the only other option was to lie.

Kieran sighed and stood from his seat. He walked over to Daniel's side and took his hands again, crouching to our son's level.

"You know, your mom gave me the greatest gift in the world," he said. He reached up and gently patted Daniel's head. "You. And for that? I'll always love her."

My ch**t tightened. For ten years, I'd desperately wanted to hear those words from Kieran, and now, there they were-while I held divorce papers in my hands.

But I knew what they truly meant-Kieran only married me because I gave him Daniel. He only tolerated me for a decade because I was the mother of his heir.

It was more proof that our marriage was one-sided.

His true, unconditional love was reserved for Celeste.

A choked sound escaped me.

Kieran went rigid. His head snapped up, wolf-quick, those gold-flecked eyes narrowing at the door.

"We don't spy on private conversations," he said coolly, rising to his full height. The Alpha voice. The one that made the pack members bow automatically.

I took a deep breath and pushed the door open.

"Mommy!" Daniel stood and went to me, throwing his arms around my waist.

"Hi, honey." I ki**ed the top of his head.

"Is it true?" he asked, looking up at me with wide, glassy eyes.

I st**ked his head. "I-"

"Danny, give your mom and me some space, okay? Go help Chef with dinner preparations."

Daniel pouted. "But-"

"Now." That single word carried the weight of command.

I squeezed his shoulder reassuringly. "We'll talk more at home, baby. Go on."

Daniel sighed and walked out, his shoulders slightly slumped.

I closed the door behind me.

Kieran's gaze dropped to the papers in my hand. Something unreadable flickered across his face.

"I assume those are the papers?"

I nodded, suddenly feeling nervous.

"My lawyer drafted the agreement, stating the custody terms." I moved forward and placed the document on the desk.

"Everything's clearly outlined-visitation schedules, holidays, education decisions..."

Kieran opened the folder and pulled out the documents. His eyebrows furrowed in concentration as his eyes darted over the pages.

"Um, I also met with a realtor she suggested," I continued, clasping my hands before me. 

"She showed me a lovely house about thirty minutes from here. It's fully furnished-ready to move in-and the mortgage is very reasonable. It's in neutral territory, so you can visit anyt-"

"Where's the fire?"

I paused, frowning at Kieran. "What?"

"I'm the one who asked for a divorce." He dropped the papers on the desk. 

"Yet here you are with moving plans and legal documents before the ink's even dry. Were you counting down the days?"

The truth burned my tongue-yes, every single one of the 3,652 days we'd been married. 

But admitting that would only give him more ammunition to use against me in the custody battle I feared was coming.

Kieran scoffed at my silence and sat back in his chair. "Leave the address of your new home," he said. 

"My son and I will have dinner, then I'll send him your way, along with your signed copy of the papers."

The finality in his voice extinguished my hope of one last family meal. Of course, the great Alpha Kieran wouldn't deign to break bread with his soon-to-be ex-wife.

I left Kieran's office, the hole in my ch**t yawning further. I hadn't been able to sleep last night after the news, so I'd used that time to pack all my belongings.

I'd never been given a proper chance to make this place my home, so everything I owned fit into two suitcases.

After loading my car with it, instead of driving away, I just sat in the driver's seat.

I stared up at the house before me, recalling all my memories. The ones I'd made with Daniel were bright and colorful, filled with love and laughter. 

But the memories of Kieran were grey, dull, and empty. Every stilted conversation, every withheld touch, every smile he saved for someone else.

The shrill ringtone shattered my reverie. My mother's name flashing on the screen sent ice through my veins. 

Two calls in as many days after a decade of silence? The universe clearly had jokes.

"Hi, Mom." I forced cheer into my voice. "How are you holding up?"

She bypassed pleasantries like always. "Is it true?"

My fingers tightened around the phone. "Is what true?"

"That you're finally divorcing Kieran."

The breath left my lungs. Of course she knew. Kieran had probably called Celeste last night.

"Yes," I ground out between clenched teeth.

The sound of my mother's relieved sigh cut deeper than any bl**e. Actual, gods-damned relief.

"It's for the best," she said. "The marriage was a mistake to begin with. This... this is the correction we've all been waiting for."

My mouth fell open. A single, betrayed tear slipped free. What kind of mother celebrates her daughter's heartbreak? 

The answer came swiftly and bitterly-the kind who always wanted her other daughter to win.

I hung up without another word and powered off my phone before she could twist the kn**e further.

Just then, the front door opened, and Daniel walked out. Kieran walked out after him, shouldering a large duffle bag. 

I frowned. No way that was all Daniel's things. Kieran was making a point-it didn't matter that we moved, Daniel's home was still here.

Daniel saw me in the car, and his eyes lit up. I exited the car as he rushed to me, and I hugged him.

"I said I'd bring him over," Kieran snapped, coming closer.

"I'm sorry, I just wanted-"

"Is this how it's going to be?" he cut me off. "It's bad enough you're moving my son away from me, but you're also cutting into my time with him?"

Daniel's small hand tugged at Kieran's sleeve. "Dad... It's okay." His voice was soft but steady. "We'll see each other tomorrow. At Grandpa's funeral."

Kieran's jaw clenched hard enough to crack stone. For a heartbeat, I thought he might argue-but then he exhaled sharply and ruffled Daniel's hair.

"Yeah. Tomorrow, champ." His gaze flicked to me, cold and dismissive. "Be good for your mother."

He handed the duffle bag to me and went back inside without another word.

I swallowed the lump in my throat and loaded the bag in silence. 

Daniel climbed into the passenger seat without complaint, his too-wise eyes watching me carefully. 

As I pulled away, I forced myself not to look back-not at the house, not at the life I'd failed to make work.

Two minutes into the drive, Daniel rummaged through his backpack and produced a slightly squashed sandwich.

"You didn't eat dinner," he said simply, pressing it into my hand.

The tears I'd been trying so hard to hold in spilled out.

"Daniel..." My voice cracked. "Do you hate me? For this? For taking you away from your dad?"

He considered it with a solemnity no nine-year-old should possess. My heart stalled, braced for the blow-

"No." He fiddled with his seatbelt. "I know you were sad a lot. Maybe now you can be happy."

A sob tore free. The road blurred. His small hand slipped into mine, squeezing tight.

"Don't cry, Mom." His whisper was fierce with promise. "You've got me. I'll make you happy."

I brought his knuckles to my lips, tasting salt and hope. So what if Kieran never loved me? 

This remarkable boy did-wholeheartedly, unconditionally-and in that moment, it was enough.

More than enough.

Chapter 5 SERAPHINA'S POV--THE FUNERAL
Another sleepless night.

The irony wasn't lost on me-I hadn't shared a b*d with Kieran in years, yet the unfamiliar silence of this new house felt louder than any absence. 

Every time I closed my eyes, the gh**ts of what might have been danced behind my lids.

Three times I'd crept down the hall to check on Daniel, only to find him curled peacefully under his Star Wars comforter, his breathing deep and even. 

Thank the moon for small mercies. This modest house might lack the imposing security of the Alpha Manor, but I'd fill every inch with enough love to compensate.

When dawn's pale fingers finally pried through my blackout curtains, a lead weight settled in my stomach.

Today we'd bury my father.

I dressed slowly, each movement weighted with dread. It wasn't grief that paralyzed me-our relationship had died long before his heart stopped beating. 

No, it was the prospect of facing my family's judgmental stares, of standing across a coffin from Kieran while our divorce papers gathered fresh ink.

Ex-husband. The term scraped against my raw nerves.

Daniel's door creaked as I pushed it open. 

My breath caught-there he sat, already dressed in the miniature black suit we'd picked out together, his small fingers deftly maneuvering his Nintendo Switch.

"Morning, Mom." He flashed me a smile that didn't quite reach his eyes.

Tears pricked my lashes. Where had my baby gone? The boy staring back at me wore Kieran's strong jawline, his piercing gaze. 

A living reminder of everything I'd lost-and everything I'd gained.

"Look at you," I whispered, smoothing his lapel. "All grown up."

Sadness shadowed his face, but he steeled himself and put the video game console aside. "Let's go," he whispered, shoulders squaring with forced bravery.

But when the old stone church loomed into view, Daniel's courage faltered. His knuckles whitened around the car door handle.

"Hey." I cupped his tense shoulder. "Talk to me."

When he turned, the unshed tears in his eyes shattered me. "We didn't... we didn't get to say goodbye. Does that mean Grandpa doesn't know we loved him?"

The question hit like a silver da**er between my ribs. 

While my father's absence had become my normal, Daniel had lost his favorite storytelling partner, his secret cookie supplier.

I pressed my palm over his thundering heart. "Grandpa's right here, my love." My voice cracked. "And here." I tapped his temple gently. "As long as we remember him, he's never really gone."

Daniel exhaled shakily, some of the tension leaving his small frame. "Okay."

"Ready?"

His nod was all the strength I needed. Together, we stepped out of the car.

The church doors swallowed us into a sea of mourners-pack members in their finest black, allies from neighboring territories, and a scattering of human associates who'd done business with my father. 

The air hummed with whispered condolences and the cloying scent of lilies.

My family sat like royalty in the front pew. My mother's head rested against Ethan's shoulder, while Celeste-

Gods.

Even in grief, my sister looked like she'd stepped from a magazine spread. 

Sunlight through stained glass windows gilded her perfect blonde waves, her designer dress clinging to curves that had always made my own frame feel boyish in comparison.

"Daniel, darling!" My mother's arms opened wide as we approached-not for me, never for me-but for the grandson who carried the Blackthorne name. The grandson who mattered.

I watched numbly as Daniel was enfolded in her embrace, his small frame disappearing against her black lace.

That left only one vacant seat-sandwiched between Celeste and the end of the pew.

My sister's glacial blue eyes raked over me. A decade apart, yet her hatred hadn't dimmed. 

She inched away as I sat, the silk of her dress whispering against the pew like a snake's warning.

Trying to force my thoughts away from the family who didn't want me, I let my gaze wander round the hall-and land on another family that didn't want me. 

The Blackthornes occupied the opposite side of the aisle, Kieran's broad shoulders cutting an imposing silhouette beside his parents.

Leona Blackthorne's lips pursed when she noticed me looking. Like my family rejected me, the Blackthornes refused to accept me. To them, I was Kieran's legal wife, not his Luna.

His mother, Leona, still held the title of Luna even after the Alpha title was passed to Kieran. 

Now, she regarded me icily. I'm sure she was ecstatic over the divorce news. The stain on her family was finally gone.

A small, warm hand slipped into mine. Daniel had extricated himself from my mother's clutches and now formed a living barrier between me and Celeste. His fingers squeezed mine-a silent I'm here.

I squeezed back, drawing strength from this remarkable child who shouldn't have needed to be the brave one. 

The organ's mournful chords signaled the service's start. Just a few more hours. I could hold myself together that long. Couldn't I?

***

I had to give Celeste credit-her timing was impeccable.

She waited through the entire service. Waited through the graveside ceremony as we each scattered handfuls of earth onto our father's coffin. 

Waited until the crowd dispersed, leaving only Daniel and me watching the gravediggers begin their solemn work.

"How thoughtful of you to offer help with the funeral arrangements." Her voice sliced through my grief like a silver bl**e.

I stiffened but didn't turn. "I meant it." The hollow ache in my ch**t deepened. 

My single text offering assistance had gone unanswered-my mother's silence spoke volumes. With Celeste back, I was more obsolete.

Celeste's laugh was all sharp edges. "As if anyone would accept anything from you."

The wind carried her cloying jasmine perfume as she stepped closer. "Ten years, sister," she hissed. 

"Ten years you played house with my life. But I'm reclaiming what's mine-my family, my position..." Her breath warmed my ear. "My Kieran."

I almost started laughing in front of my father's grave.

The absurdity-Celeste had always owned them all. Their love, their loyalty, Kieran's heart-none of it had ever truly been mine to lose.

"Welcome home," I murmured to the freshly turned earth. Today was about honoring my father, not fighting battles I was destined to lose.

Celeste always won.

The crunch of gravel announced her departure. I didn't need to look to know she'd gone straight to Kieran-could picture perfectly how Leona's face would light up, how Kieran's arms would open instinctively.

When Daniel shifted beside me, I caught the confirmation in my periphery: Celeste tucked against Kieran's ch**t like she belonged there, smirking over his shoulder.

"Mom?" Daniel's small hand found mine. My brave boy, standing guard between me and the world. "Can I go see Grandma?"

The plea in his eyes undid me. However much they rejected me, Daniel deserved his family. 

"Of course, sweetheart." My k**s lingered in his hair as he dashed away.

From across the field, I watched Christian scoop Daniel up with grandfatherly ease, Leona fussing over his suit.

At least they loved him-the one good thing to come from this sham of a marriage.

Alone now, I faced the gaping hole in the earth. The gaping hole in my life.

"Goodbye, Dad," I whispered to the wind, my tears falling not just for the father I'd lost, but for the daughter he'd never truly seen.

I turned from my father's grave, my heels sinking into the soft earth as I made for the sanctuary of my car. I'd wait there-alone, invisible-until this miserable affair was over.

I was halfway out of the gravesite when chaos ensued.

One minute: a somber afternoon pierced only by muffled sobs.

The next: a nightmare of snarls and screams as rogues poured from the tree line like shadows given teeth.

Daniel.

His name was a prayer on my lips as I whirled back, scanning the chaos. 

My brother's wolf stood guard over our mother, his fangs dripping crimson. Across the clearing, Kieran's massive golden-brown form circled Celeste-of course.

No one looked my way. No one remembered the wolfless daughter, the defective mate, the easy target.

The rogues noticed.

Yellow eyes locked onto me as gaunt forms slunk closer, nostrils flaring at the scent of my fear.

"Daniel!" My scream tore through the cacophony. Where was he? Who-

A crushing weight slammed into my back, claws tearing across my skin.

I hit the ground hard, the world tilting as I scrambled backward. 

Above me, an emaciated rogue wolf loomed, rancid drool splattering my cheeks as it snarled.

This was it. After everything, I'd die on my knees in the dirt.

My gaze darted desperately through the fray. My shoulder was on fire, hot, thick liquid trickling down my back, but all that mattered was Daniel.

The rogue lunged.

Please, I silently begged whatever deity was listening, just let me see him one last time-

......
